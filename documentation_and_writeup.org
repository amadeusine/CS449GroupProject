*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, I need an empty board consisting of 4 expanded squares with 8 equidistant positions
    each to play a game of Nine Men's Morris.
** User Input and Selection
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, I need to be able to select and choose input from the web GUI of the application to
    be able to play and take turns at Nine Men's Morris.
** Starting a Game
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, I need a GUI to prompt me with the options to start a game with either another human
    or against the computer for Nine Men's Morris in order to play the game.
** Assigning Players
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, I need to be assigned the role as either the first or second player, whether against
    another human or the computer, in order to know my player turn (either first or second) in the
    game.
** Piece Placement
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, I need to place nine pieces on unoccupied positions in turn with another player to
    start off a game of Nine Men's Morris.
** Piece Movement
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, I need to be able to move my pieces into adjacent positions that are not occupied by
    the other player or adjacent to their mill in order to take a turn.
** Mill Formation
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, I need the game to recognize that I have formed a mill upon moving three of my own
    pieces into adjacent positions so that I may gain the future ability to attack and defend my
    mill pieces from being eliminated.
** Piece Elimination
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, after forming a mill, I need the ability to remove an opponent's piece of my choosing
    so long as either it is not in a mill or any piece given all available pieces are in a mill, so
    that I may appropriately attack my opponent.
** Flying Pieces
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, upon reaching three remaining pieces, I need the ability to fly (jump) my pieces
    across the board to any un-occupied point in order to play Nine Men's Morris according to the
    rules. Whether the position is guarded is a variant of the game, implementation decision TBD.
** Defining End of Game
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, when either myself or the opponent reaches less than three pieces, i.e. two pieces, I
    need the game and to declare the respective winner in order to successfully finish a game of
    Nine Men's Morris.
** Restarting and Replaying a Game
*** Description
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UNNUMBERED: t
    :END:
    As a user, after having completed a game of Nine Men's Morris, I need the GUI to prompt me to
    either play again or to end the game software so that I can accordingly choose whether to keep
    playing or to end my game session.
