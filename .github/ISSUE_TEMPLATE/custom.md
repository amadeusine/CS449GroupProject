# summary
<!-- Example:

In order for the front-end to both *initiate* and communicate *back* to the rust module export, the Rust module needs to have a means to translate the following native game types to their JS equivalents:

  - [ ] `Board`
  - [ ] `GameState`
  
-->

## clarifications
<!-- Example:

- The rust module has `GameState`, but meeting minutes and the generated design outlines have this as `BoardState`. Which is it?
-->

##  potential blockers
<!-- Example:

- there is a great chance #23 will add to the criteria required by this issue, but there isn't much else to say until that time comes.

-->
