* nmm notes
** TODO BoardStruct representing position placement and player
   - currently a hashmap of coord and bool
   - need to add information for what player is positioned, if any.
   - maybe just change value to tuple (bool, Option<Player>)?
** TODO figure out Neon values that get returned
   - looks like only need to worry about JSArray and JSObject
** TODO static hashmap of valid coords(?)
** TODO receive coordstruct {X, Y}
   - JS object type, X and Y will be strings, A-G, 1-7
