  Below you will find a table that makes up our "User Story Board", with some simplifications taken
  with respect to the total contents of the board. With respect to the final formal documentation,
  i.e. this paper, we only keep the basic qualitative and quantitative values for each story in the
  table while giving each user story proper its own section. This makes documenting each story
  less unruly while also easier to read. Each Story I.D. (SID) value is internally linked to its
  respective story, which also helps with navigating this section.
