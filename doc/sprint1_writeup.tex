\section{Micro Charter}
\label{sec:orgb8a919b}
\subsection{Project Name}
\label{sec:orgb02c299}
N Men Morris
\subsection{Vision Statement}
\label{sec:orgeef5c88}
Create a extensible framework for board game web apps with scalability and performance.
\subsection{Mission Statement}
\label{sec:org19abd1c}
To play Nine Men's Morris on the web browser using a composable web technology stack that allows
for future modularity while not foregoing performance.
\subsection{Elevator Pitch and Business Value}
\label{sec:org454fe0f}
We are creating Nine Men's Morris on a board game framework using Express.js and Neon for
Rust. This allows for a data and type safe application that is capable of composability,
scalability, extensibility, and performance.
\subsection{Customers and Users}
\label{sec:orgfa92795}
\begin{itemize}
\item Customers: Entrepreneurs and ventures that want to deploy board games on the web with low
overhead, latency, and maintenance.
\item Users: Individuals who are passionate about board games and want a new online experience that
they can take and play wherever they go with their friends.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:org3239cee}
By benchmarking N Men Morris, we can compare our solution to other products on the market on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item latency
\item binary size
\item up-time
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Milestones}
\label{sec:orgaaad914}
\begin{enumerate}
\item First MVP
\item First Offline N Men's Morris
\item Player versus Player (Offline)
\item Player versus Player (Online)
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Risks}
\label{sec:org51a1c88}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Inherent complexity of technology stack.
\item Inability to cooperate with teammates.
\item Plausibility of orphaning project due to development team size.

\section{User Stories}
\label{sec:orgeab8e19}
Below you will find a table that makes up our "User Story Board", with some simplifications taken
with respect to the total contents of the board. With respect to the final formal documentation,
i.e. this paper, we only keep the basic qualitative and quantitative values for each story in the
table while giving each user story proper its own section. This makes documenting each story
less unruly while also easier to read. Each Story I.D. (SID) value is internally linked to its
respective story, which also helps with navigating this section.

\subsection{Mills Board}
\label{sec:org4191c93}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:org7e704b0}
As a user, I need an empty board consisting of 4 expanded squares with 8 equidistant positions
each to play a game of Nine Men's Morris.
\subsection{User Input and Selection}
\label{sec:orgb019917}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:org58fd437}
As a user, I need to be able to select and choose input from the web GUI of the application to
be able to play and take turns at Nine Men's Morris.
\subsection{Starting a Game}
\label{sec:org7eeeae9}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:org23ff7eb}
As a user, I need a GUI to prompt me with the options to start a game with either another human
or against the computer for Nine Men's Morris in order to play the game.
\subsection{Assigning Players}
\label{sec:org8bd740f}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:orga89fde6}
As a user, I need to be assigned the role as either the first or second player, whether against
another human or the computer, in order to know my player turn (either first or second) in the
game.
\subsection{Piece Placement}
\label{sec:org35a6430}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:org7911e3a}
As a user, I need to place nine pieces on unoccupied positions in turn with another player to
start off a game of Nine Men's Morris.
\subsection{Piece Movement}
\label{sec:orga93afe5}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:orgf549f76}
As a user, I need to be able to move my pieces into adjacent positions that are not occupied by
the other player or adjacent to their mill in order to take a turn.
\subsection{Mill Formation}
\label{sec:orgbc9cdbf}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:org6cb7fc8}
As a user, I need the game to recognize that I have formed a mill upon moving three of my own
pieces into adjacent positions so that I may gain the future ability to attack and defend my
mill pieces from being eliminated.
\subsection{Piece Elimination}
\label{sec:org1506c30}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:orge4fe016}
As a user, after forming a mill, I need the ability to remove an opponent's piece of my choosing
so long as either it is not in a mill or any piece given all available pieces are in a mill, so
that I may appropriately attack my opponent.
\subsection{Flying Pieces}
\label{sec:org2091b47}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:org7e5abdd}
As a user, upon reaching three remaining pieces, I need the ability to fly (jump) my pieces
across the board to any un-occupied point in order to play Nine Men's Morris according to the
rules. Whether the position is guarded is a variant of the game, implementation decision TBD.
\subsection{Defining End Game}
\label{sec:orga3ce3cf}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:orged5132a}
As a user, when either myself or the opponent reaches less than three pieces, i.e. two pieces, I
need the game and to declare the respective winner in order to successfully finish a game of
Nine Men's Morris.
\subsection{Restarting and Replaying a Game}
\label{sec:org13702bc}
\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{sec:org2b9bb52}
As a user, after having completed a game of Nine Men's Morris, I need the GUI to prompt me to
either play again or to end the game software so that I can accordingly choose whether to keep
playing or to end my game session.
\section{Acceptance Criteria}
\label{sec:org469b4b7}
The following section covers the acceptance criteria enumerated in response to the User Stories
discovered and documented in \hyperref[sec:orgeab8e19]{\(\S{2}\)}. In a similar fashion to \(\S{2}\), the table documenting these
acceptance criteria is in a simplified form. Every Acceptance Criterion has an Acceptance
Criterion ID (\texttt{ACID}), which is associated in the table below with its respective \texttt{SID}, development
status, and the developers responsible for implementing it. Each \texttt{ACID} is linked to its respective
subsection below for viewing the description of each criterion.

\subsection{Meeting 2019.09.27}
\label{sec:orgd3cf2b3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Duration: 1 Hour, 30 minutes
\item Location: Miller Nichols Library
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Agenda}
\label{sec:org586a824}
\begin{itemize}
\item discuss project structure
\item acceptance criteria
\item work assignment
\item remaining TODOs
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Project Structure}
\label{sec:orga99a9b1}
\begin{itemize}
\item express.js has a lot of dependencies, only really need connect.js
\begin{itemize}
\item might try just using connect.js, which would be a lot simpler
\item will continue with using Neon
\end{itemize}
\item board
\begin{itemize}
\item gui
\begin{itemize}
\item js renders the fontend
\item logic/data is all handled on back
\end{itemize}
\item data structure/representation
\begin{itemize}
\item two choices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item one big board object that includes methods for both resolving where players are \textbf{and}
where things like mills are
\item two object entities, one is purely for the GUI (tracking positions on the board), the
other would be some kind of graph structure that allows position nodes to check peers
for occupation and whether it is the same or opposing players
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\item movement and move validity
\begin{itemize}
\item need to track flying
\begin{itemize}
\item proposition: flying is a universal property, merely constrained until player count is
reduced.
\begin{itemize}
\item need some kind of getter/setter between board and entity management system
\end{itemize}
\item mill detection
\begin{itemize}
\item if going with entity system, would merely be a graph traversal from any given node
\item another idea: create a mill entity system that tracks active mills and checks each
mill upon each turn(?) and modifies or destroys the mill as necessary.
\begin{itemize}
\item could save a lot of checking
\item as for organization/logical membership, would keep such a mill entity system
independent of other objects in the system for simplicity, at least for now.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Checking for attack
\begin{itemize}
\item if a mill entity system is used, we natively have a means to detect valid attacks. so
long as the node is not in one of the mills, do not attack \textbf{unless} all available
nodes are in mills.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item game driver
\begin{itemize}
\item Will have some kind of Game entity/manager object that drives the game event loop.
\begin{itemize}
\item will take inputs from players, run them as game moves
\begin{itemize}
\item however, internal logic to the entity management system is what will ultimately validate moves
\item game manager will have no logic for why this happens, only passes back and for game
inputs and the results of moves.
\end{itemize}
\item consequentially, need to codify where and how game validation logic happens
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item validation logic
\begin{itemize}
\item as of now, think it will be handled by the main entity management system
\item will have a set of logic checking methods defined over the system that verify whether a
given move is allowed
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Acceptance Criteria}
\label{sec:org43c25f8}
\begin{itemize}
\item realized we need to add numbering to the board GUI (a-g, 1-7)
\item (deferred, Sam will begin working on before next meeting)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Work Assignment}
\label{sec:orgd8ad151}
\begin{itemize}
\item elias will begin on exploratory work for the backend (board, entity management, etc)
\item sam, michael will begin exploratory work for the frontend (GUI, communicating with backend)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} }
\label{sec:orge1a2cc1}
\begin{itemize}
\item[{$\square$}] kanban board setup, finalization of workflow for documentation
\begin{itemize}
\item can probably just use github for real time management, but keep organizational and notes in
\texttt{kanban.org} file on the repo.
\end{itemize}
\item[{$\square$}] defining test cases for stories and acceptance criteria
\item[{$\square$}] refining stories
\begin{itemize}
\item same case applies with above: refine stories, and put them on github's project management
board accordingly; actual refinement can be delegated to within \texttt{kanban.org} file.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Meeting 2019.10.02}
\label{sec:org73c9af6}
\begin{itemize}
\item Duration: 1 Hour, 40 Minutes
\item Location: Miller Nichols Library
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Agenda}
\label{sec:orge11d182}
\begin{itemize}
\item addressing tagged issues generated on GitHub
\item settling on how front-end talks to back-end
\item documentation/design stuff
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Issues on GitHub}
\label{sec:org830cd47}
\begin{itemize}
\item issue \#3: determine communication channel between js and rust
\label{sec:org07da401}
\begin{itemize}
\item event polling seems overkill for what we need
\item even handler on front-end which speaks to an entity ManagerGlue, which will be the JS that
talks to rust backend
\begin{itemize}
\item There will be a manager in the back-end, which will generate game state, and return that to
the front-end
\item back-end will also have triggers (flags? Enums?) which signal to front-end when certain
actions are no longer needed or valid, i.e. button inputs or game state continuation
\end{itemize}
\item JSON seems like a good enough medium for message passing between front and back components
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item issue \#4 is largely tagged to \#3, so this resolves that
\label{sec:orgf47d0c0}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{State}: Input Handle + BoardStruct + Trigger)
\item \texttt{BoardState}
\begin{itemize}
\item this is what gets sent back to the JS
\item 1D array of the \texttt{State} struct
\begin{itemize}
\item this array will be handed off as a NeonJS object, whatever it's called in neon
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item issue \#6: Front-end/GUI Skeleton, Basic Design
\label{sec:orgf89357c}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Neon builds a node module
\item This is sent to express.js
\begin{itemize}
\item accepts it as a bunch of js functions
\end{itemize}
\item Express takes this, as a bunch of objects, and then saves as strings to JS files, in turn
statically served to end user (i.e. browser)
\begin{itemize}
\item express.js interaction is a one-off affair
\end{itemize}
\item Stretch goal: being able to set different themes on the front-end
\end{enumerate}
\item issue \#8: CI/CD
\label{sec:orgad4bb71}
\begin{itemize}
\item GitHub has native CI/CD now via it's Action's service.
\item can impl for both Rust and Node.js
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} }
\label{sec:org699eff6}

\item event diagram
\item general UML diagram for total project
\item class hierarchy/component diagram
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Meeting 2019.10.06}
\label{sec:orgde8622a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Duration: 7 hours
\item Location: Video Call
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Agenda}
\label{sec:org6a7b279}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tying up loose ends with respect to documentation and write up
\item Tying up loose ends with respect to UI/JS end of the application
\item Discussing what is left to do with the project
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Documentation and Write-up}
\label{sec:org043f3eb}
\begin{itemize}
\item Figured out how to format the tables given that many of the ones provided do not play well
with latex/org-mode markdown
\item Similarly, decided on how to interconnect documentation components between sections
\item Discussed the remaining things left undocumented, particularly pair ratings.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{UI/JS Loose Ends}
\label{sec:org115fbc9}
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete manual testing of interacting elements
\item Finalize positions of clickable elements on the board grid.
\item Alternating player logic for placement of pieces.
\item Limiting piece placement to nine.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Discussing Future Sprint/Direction of Project}
\label{sec:org3f726e3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Current User Stories are pseudo-Epics and need to be refined into better User stories aside
from \hyperref[sec:org4191c93]{S1}. As they stand, discussing the current user stories makes for overly generic/abstract
discussion and doesn't meaningfully translate into logic/behavior to implement and actual
engineering tasks.
\item Currently, the front end mocks all of the behavior/functionality that would otherwise be
provided by the backend. In sprint 2, this is where the real meat of programming will come in
as we learn to make the back-end and front-end interface, particularly with translating data
types across the FFI boundary through Neon.
\item We need to improve the current state documentation massively.
\begin{itemize}
\item Design diagrams.
\item Docstrings across software code base.
\item Event diagrams.
\end{itemize}
\item Translate the above issues into their proper documentation for the master documentation and
write-up file
\item How to test more of the functionality given that a major component of this application is
running directly on the browser.
\end{itemize}
