* Sprint 1 Summary
  - Project: N Men's Morris
  - Members: Elias Garcia, Samuel Lim, Michael Cu
  - Team Name: MISAEL
** Mission Statement
   To play Nine Men’s Morris on the web browser using a composable web technology
   stack that allows for future modularity while not foregoing performance.

** Pitch and Business value
   We are creating Nine Men’s Morris on a board game framework using Express.js and Neon for
   Rust. This allows for a data and type safe application that is capable of composability,
   scalability, extensibility, and performance.

* Tech Stack
   - Vanilla JS, TypeScript, EJS Templates
     + Served statically using Express.js
     + Interfaces to back-end
   - Rust and Neon
     + Statically compiled and type safe back-end
     + Neon library allows safe and efficient FFI with JS
* Workflow (Rust)
   - Enumeration on Coordinates
   - Position Class
   - Player Type
   - Game State Class
     - Board Storage
* Workflow (JS)
  - Mirrored Rust datatypes in TypeScript for mocking and testing front-end
  - Added Window class (with logic restrictions)
    + Interfaces with GUI
* Workflow (Agile/Scrum)
  - Meetings
    + outlined issues
    + teased out requirements
    + User stories, AC
  - GitHub
    + Translated meeting details to issues and projects
* Workflow (GUI)
  - Deploy on Browser with CSS Grid
* Testing
  - Tested interactive elements
  - Implementation of board placement
    + Partial Board
    + Full Board
* Experience/Lessons Learned
  - Meet more regularly.
    + Met 7 times before submission.
    + Still felt like there were issues, topics we could have better addressed.
  - Using GitHub PRs, Issues
  - Testing mockups and GUI
    + Testing isn't as intuitive when main driver not implemented yet.
